# Lab 3: Asymptotic Analysis

This lab focuses on understanding and analyzing the asymptotic behavior of algorithms. We will explore concepts such as Big-O, Big-$\Theta$, and Big-$\Omega$ notations, and apply them to various algorithmic problems to determine their efficiency and scalability.

**Instructions:** To complete this lab, you may work in groups, but you must write your solutions yourself. Once you have completed the lab, push your changes to your forked repository.

## Problem 1

Suppose $T(n)$ is the worst case running time of an algorithm with input size $n$, and we know that $T(n)$ is $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ and $\Omega(n^2)$. For each of the following statements, determine whether it must be true, must be false, or could be either true or false. Give a brief justification for each. 

1. $T(n)$ is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.
This could be True because $\Omega(n^2)$ is the best case running time and is equal to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. Our unknown function could be running at best case and worst case running time simultaneously for $n^2$ steps.

This could also be False because the unknown function could not have equal best case and worst case running times.

2. $T(n)$ is $\Theta(n^3)$.
3. $T(n)$ is $\Omega(n)$.
4. $T(n)$ is $\Theta(n^{1.5})$.
5. $T(n)$ is $\mathcal{O}(n)$.
6. $T(n)$ is $\Theta(n^2 \log n)$.


## Problem 2
Consider the following algorithm where $f(A, i, j)$ is an unknown algorithm that takes as input an array $A$ and two indicies $i$ and $j$ and returns a number. 

```
Mystery Algorithm
Input: An array of int $A$ of length $n$.
Output: int sum
    n = |A|
    sum = 0
    for i = 1 to n:
        for j = 1 to n:
            sum += f(A, i, j)
```

Without knowing anything about $f$, what can we say about the running time of the Mystery Algorithm in terms of $n$? Justify your answer.
